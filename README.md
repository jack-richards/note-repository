## Required Configuration
- If you do not have a active MongoDB Atlas instance and plan to use a local database, follow the necessary steps to [download and install](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/) MongoDB.
- Edit ``appsettings.json`` and add your MongoDB database [connection string](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/). A MongoDB Atlas [connection URL](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/atlas/connection-string/) will also work.

## Release
For a built version of the application please refer to the releases. Once downloaded, ensure that you follow the step mentioned above. From there, simply run ``NoteRepository.exe``.
